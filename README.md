# ShaderProject
Rudimentary tool for shader debugging, tweaking, and showcasing

Author: Thomas Loudiana

Description:  A tool used for shader debugging, tweaking, and showcasing.  Runs on top of DirectX9 and shaders are written in
HLSL.  Current effects are: ambient, diffuse, specular, gooch, phong, bump map, toon, sub-surface scatter, and shadowmapping.

Installation:  Other than DirectX 9 and Win32 no dependancies.  Simply clone and compile on a windows machine.

Controls:  

    W,A,S,D - movement
    Left Mouse Drag - Look
    Right Mouse Drag - Move light
    Left/Right Arrows - cycle effects
    R - recompile shaders
    C - reset camera
    L - reset light

Future:  This is a project that I continue to expand.  The framework is complete but I love learning about and
adding new effects.
